VBA Exercise - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background
The goal of this assignment is to use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. The stock market file contained three sheets with data from 2014, 2015 and 2016.

## Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Solution
The script loops through all of the stocks data and displays the information above. The script also runs for every worksheet by running through once.
